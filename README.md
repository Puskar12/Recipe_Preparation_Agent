# Overview
Recipe Preparation Agent is an AI-powered assistant that helps users cook meals using only the ingredients they already have. It suggests personalized recipes, offers substitutions, gives step-by-step instructions, and adjusts for dietary preferences—all powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and IBM Granite foundation models.

# Features

✅ Ingredient-based recipe generation  
✅ Smart substitutions for missing items  
✅ Step-by-step cooking instructions  
✅ Supports dietary preferences (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)  
✅ Built with IBM Cloud Lite + watsonx.ai  
✅ Runs fully in IBM Prompt Lab — no deployment required  
✅ Reduces food waste through smart meal planning

# Usage

### 1. IBM Prompt Lab (Preview & Test)

- Open the Prompt Lab asset in IBM watsonx.ai  
- Type something like:  
  `"I have potatoes, tomato, and onion. What can I cook?"`  
- Get recipes, instructions, and substitution tips instantly

# 🍛 Example Prompts

- “Can I cook something without using oil?”  
- “Suggest recipes based on current weather”  
- “Suggest a high-protein meal”  
- “Suggest a dinner using leftover rice and vegetables.”

# ☁️ IBM Cloud Services Used

- IBM Watsonx.ai Prompt Lab  
- IBM Granite Foundation Model  
- IBM IAM (access control)  
- IBM Cloud Object Storage *(optional)*

# 🔧 How It Works

- **Prompt Engineering**: Custom prompt template defines AI behavior  
- **Retriever**: Extracts relevant recipe info from external/public data  
- **Generator**: Produces human-like recipe steps using foundation models  
- **No fine-tuning required** – relies on IBM’s built-in LLMs

# ✅ Do’s and Don’ts

### ✅ Do:
- Ask for recipes with available ingredients  
- Request substitutions or cooking help  
- Use clear and specific ingredient lists

### ❌ Don’t:
- Input sensitive health data  
- Treat it as professional medical/dietary advice  
- Expect conversation memory (stateless unless designed)

# 🚀 Future Scope

- Voice assistant integration (cook hands-free)  
- Weekly meal planner with grocery checklist  
- Integration with food delivery or inventory systems  
- Multilingual recipe generation  
- Nutrition & calorie breakdown
